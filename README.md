## Installation for developers
 
### 1. Using Docker

Run the following command and all the necessary dependences will be installed:

```
 docker-compose up
```

Depending on how Docker/Docker Compose was installed in your machine you may need to run this command as a super user.

### 2. Installing Audiencias localy

#### Install dependences

First of all, you need to install [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). 

After install these dependencies enter inside the directory where you download this repository, and run the following commands in the root:
(P.S: You may need to run some of the following commands as super user)

```
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
apt install redis
apt install redis-server
npm install node-sass
```

After install redis check if it is running in your computer using:

```
sudo systemctl status redis
```

#### Install Edem Navigation top bar

You just need to run the following commands if you are using it inside CÃ¢mara dos Deputados. Otherwise you can skip then and go to the next section (Running the Audiencias).

Go to templates/components/edem-navigation directory

```
cd templates/components/edem-navigation
```

Run the following gits to get the git submodule of the edem navigation bar:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote
